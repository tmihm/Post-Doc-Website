abstract: In periodic solids, errors in the energies are typically thought to
  converge to the thermodynamic limit (TDL), or bulk, with an N^(-1) scaling,
  where N is the number of electrons in the system. However, in our analysis of
  the coupled cluster doubles correlation energy in the high density of the
  uniform electron gas, where coupled cluster is taken to be exact, we found the
  error scales as N^(-1/3). Through analysis of the part of the coupled cluster
  wavefunction known as the transition structure factor, whose convergence to
  the TDL mirrors that of the errors, we show where and how each convergence
  rate occurs and how they can be applied to solids in general.
