abstract: " We performed a numerical analysis on the thermodynamic limit (TDL) extrapolation power laws for the coupled cluster doubles correlation energy in the uniform electron gas using a new cost-reducing twist averaging method we recently developed.[1] The thermodynamic limit energies were found for a range of densities. The high-density limit, where exact TDL values are known, was then used to determine the convergence rate which showed a different convergence than the accepted 1/N rate.
