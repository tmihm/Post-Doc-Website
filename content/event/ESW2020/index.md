abstract: "We performed a numerical analysis on the thermodynamic limit (TDL) extrapolation power laws
for the coupled cluster doubles correlation energy in the uniform electron gas using a new costreducing twist averaging method we recently developed.[1] The thermodynamic limit energies were found for a range of densities. The high-density limit, where exact TDL values are known, was then used to determine the convergence rate which showed a different convergence than the accepted 1/N rate \n
